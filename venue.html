        <h2>Roundhouse, Camden</h2>
        <p id="location">

            As former railway engine repair sheds turned music venues go, The
            Roundhouse is without doubt the best in the entire world… In all
            seriousness though, it’s an incredible venue, and its unique history
            and architecture is what makes it so sensational (see the incredible
            roof as evidence). The building was transformed into a
            groundbreaking performing arts venue 50 years ago, and has welcomed
            legendary performances by Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, The Ramones and
            one of only two UK appearances by The Doors with Jim Morrison. Biffy
            Clyro, Happy Mondays and Jake Bugg are some of the artists to expect
            at The Roundhouse this year – the only venue of its kind.

            in 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain, Royal Festival Hall has
            become a truly inspiring arts centre. The hall is located on the
            banks of the River Thames at the heart of Southbank Centre, making
            for a remarkable location to go and watch some amazing music – from
            Ministry of Sound, to The Great Escape live in concert, with a load
            of jazz thrown in for good measure.

            What started as a busy Irish club playing host to performers such as
            Jim Reeves, has (80 years on) become Camden high street’s iconic
            music venue, which sees people queueing round the corner every day
            to watch bands from U2, The Clash, and Red Hot Chilli Peppers to Joy
            Division, The Smiths, and Blur.

        <h2>Union Chapel</h2>

            As a nominee for The London Venue Awards 2019 (and a champion of
            various other venue awards) it would be rude not to give Union
            Chapel a mention. An award-winning, architectural treasure, this
            working church is the perfect place to come and worship the music
            that you love. In 25 years, the venue has gone from facing
            demolition, to becoming a Grade I listed building. Not bad work,
            right? And a lot of this has got to come down to its title as a
            completely independent and non-for-profit venue, with acts such as
            Tom Jones, Amy Winehouse, Noel Gallagher and Elton John coming to
            bless the stage (yes, pun intended). When not hosting a concert or
            mass, the church is home to The Margins Project for those homeless
            and in crisis in London. Really, what’s not to love about Union
            Chapel?
